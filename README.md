# TraceReconstruction
Creation of a trace reconstruction software. From a Monte Carlo simulation a list of rectilinear trace are created and made interact with a detector to generate the point of interaction. After being adeguately saved using a proper format the Hought trasformation is used on GPU to reconstuct the traces. The reconstracted traces are then compared to the originals.
